Kickstarting with Excel

Week 1 Project

Overview of Project
The data set provided shows how group funding was successfull in terms of meeting the funding goal, 
it included timing that shows what was the best time to launch the funding requests for a successfull outcome. 

### Purpose
Show what the outcomes of campaigns in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. 


## Analysis and Challenges
The analysis includied looking at both the time frame and the overall size of the goal to show what was successfuall, 
what failed, and what was canceled. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Group funding was mores successfull in terms of reaching goals for campaigns with a launch date in May or June. 
The least successful months are December, October, January and August.
the other months were all above 60% funded. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The success of the goal largely depended on the size of the goal.  The smaller the goal amount the more likely it was to be successful.
If the goal was greater than 10,000 it has less than a 50% chance of success. While goals of less than $5,000 have more than a 60% chance of success. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
One ov the challenges is the data shows that more campains are successful in May and June.
A little deeper investigation was needed to determin if this was simply because there were more campaigns, 
or if it was a timing issue.



## Results

The first conclusion about outcomes based on the launch date is that it is best to launch the campaign in May. 

The second conclusion is that December is the month least likely to have a successfull campaign launched. 

If your goal is less than $10,000 you have a greater chance of success. 

The data set has a very broad range of information. Some of the information is for buildings and others for project funding. 
The data requires that more analysis be done for each type of campaing to adequately describe what happes in each category as well as time and goal amount. 

A graph and table for each category would help better understand the effects of the size of campaing as well as the timing.  For example if technology has a lower 
success rate and more of these campaings are run in December it may help explain why december has a lower success rate. 

a table and graph of the percentage for each month of success in each category. This would help determine if it was category dependant as well as date and goal size dependant.
